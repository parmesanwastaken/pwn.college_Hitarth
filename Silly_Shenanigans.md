# Bashrc Backdoor
I am asked to edit user's `.bashrc` to cat flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qz844m3FCyLcD7VHtyC_bOxvHEp.0VMzEzNxwSO2EzNzEzW}`

- I used `nano /home/zardus/.bashrc` and added command `cat /flag`
- Now when I initiated the user, it ran this and gave me the flag

## What I learned
- I learnt about `.bashrc` and its uses
